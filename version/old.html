<h2>Versioning</h2>
For all resources of NIF 2.0, we try to be consistent with versioning. 
This is achieved by using <a href="http://semver.org">http://semver.org</a> as strict as is feasible without weighing down the development process.  
Since different kinds of resources require different treatment, we distinguish between version numbers and versioning granularity. 
Furthermore, we are tracking revisions of all resources in <a href="https://github.com/NLP2RDF">GitHub</a>
In the following, we define special version numbers and their meaning for different types of resources.

<h3>Projectwide</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>NIF 2.0</b> - the current version number of NIF will not be incremented. It describes a set of resources constituting NIF, which are versioned individually as defined in this document. NIF 3.0 will be likely be picked up by an industrial standardisation organisation</li>
	<li><b>0.0.0</b> - Version number 0.0.0 signifies that no versioning is done on this resource. Changes to this resource are not tracked strictly. Developers may be able to find some infos at the GitHub repos, but even this is not guaranteed.</li>
	<li><b>0.y.z</b> - Based on #4 of SemVer.org: Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The resource should not be considered stable.</li>
	<li><b>1.y.z</b> - Based on #5 of SemVer.org: Version 1.0.0 defines the transition of this resource into a state, where other resources depend on it. 1.y.z normally means that there exists <b>one or several implementations</b>. The way in which the version number is incremented after this release is dependent on the definition in this document. </li>
</ul>
